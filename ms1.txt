Team members: Yu-Chan Jimmy Chien


Functionality incomplete: None


Estimated hours spent: about 22 hours (spent too much time learning the framework of flask and sqlite3, reading documents, and dealing with configuration.)


Parts you got stuck on (if any): Reading Documentation and Debugging on load_inspection().
Quite confused about the parameters in def add_inspection_for_restaurant(self, inspection, restaurant).
It takes me about 2 hours to realize 'inspection' and 'restaurant' refer to the post body (forgot to look at sample server).
Also, I mixed the name of schema attributes with the dictionary keys of 'inspection' and 'restaurant' when I extracted test restaurant and inspection data from json dicts.


How work was partitioned: I did the work by myself.
